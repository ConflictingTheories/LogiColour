# LogiColour
LogiColour - A puzzle game created by myself

Originally written in Processing, this simple puzzle game is based on an original colour-based circuit logic which mimics logic gates that people are typically familiar with but with a twist. The logic gates do not operate on 1's and 0's, but instead are operating on the various colours provided to it.

There are a collection of logic gates which perform different operations on the colours and it the job of the player to clear each level by connecting up all the starting colour nodes in a single circuit which is logically sound.

This requires learning the mechanics of the colour-based logic which is heavily based on the classic RGB/CMY colour wheels alongside a lesson in complexity as each block has a cost associated with it. It is you goal to solve the puzzle whilst minimizing the cost the circuit.

This leads to a multi-layered approach as the levels get more complex as players may find themselves forced to backtrack and rethink their previous choices which could have major ripple-effects into their circuits. 

All in all - I hope you will enjoy this game.

This repository should compile to android but whether it will be successful on newer OS version is hard to say. It was tested and mainly developed on Oreo and Nougat.
